							<h6 class="title2">Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing - WEB APP VAPT</h6>
							<p class="desc2">Today’s main causes for cyber espionage is a vulnerable website which is open to all. Most of the companies are not much concerned about their website security which may be containing very sensitive information or they are not aware of what happens when a website is hacked. Vulnerable websites allow an attacker to inject any malware or unwanted malicious file in a network or individual’s computer.</p>
							<p class="desc2">BWORKS has reported, traced the origin of web attacks and helped in fixing vulnerabilities of top MNC’s websites. We have expertise in finding and fixing major vulnerabilities like sql injection, cross site scripting, local file inclusion, remote file inclusion and etc. BWORKS can test these applications using either zero-knowledge testing or full-access testing to examine potential vulnerabilities.</p>

							<p class="desc2">Having business data’s online has always been a risk. It’s a world of traps, with vulnerabilities and threats placed themselves in the least expected places, at the least expected time. Every organization today has different vulnerabilities which are not been noticed at times. These loopholes are the targets of the black hat hackers. So it’s our responsibility to take initiatives to keep our self secured. </p>

							<h6 class="title2">Social Engineering Assessments</h6>

Even though if a corporate has a secured infrastructure it can be compromised very easily by social engineering. BWORKS provides training and services to identify weak links in the security chain through exploitation of human vulnerabilities.</p>

							<h6 class="title2">Identity Threat Management</h6>
							<p class="desc2">A threat against social context (as known as "social threat") is somewhat different from other technical threats against availability, confidentiality, or integrity, as previously discussed, in terms of the intention and methodology. It focuses on how to manipulate the social context between communication parties so that an attacker can misrepresent himself as a trusted entity and convey false information to the target user (victim). The typical threats against social context like Misrepresentation of identity, authority, rights, and content. Csec Provides a unique service in identifying such threats and takes down of its sources. We have designed an automated abuse box system which analysis the type of threat and reverts with the proper results.</p>

The stakes are high thus it involves the possibilities for intellectual property theft, financial loss, the compromise of customer information, public embarrassment and ultimately, the health and longevity of your organization. To avoid such hassles we Csec have took initiative in providing dedicated threat intelligence reporting service. The threat reports are designed enterprise specific on understanding their IT infrastructure and the possible threat that can be faced by an organization. Csec Threat Intelligence services provide a professional security intelligence and expert security consultation. The report includes assets targeted, threats model and the actors behind them, insight of exploit at a detailed level, and immediate mitigations to be done.</p>							
						</li>
						<li>
							<h6 class="title2">Cyber Espionage</h6>
							<p class="desc2">Today in this Cyber world every sensitive data is stored or shared through a cloud or a computer or a server so it makes very easy for the Cyber espionage rivals to sniff the sensitive information of a organization or an individual which helps cyber criminal to move one step ahead by not revealing their physical identity as in corporate espionage. This result in increase of Cyber Espionage. Countering Cyber Espionage requires a much more elaborate approach to data security. The result of espionage is information that has value to the attacker. BWORKS provides service on countering cyber espionage which stops opponent, enemy intelligence, and criminal organization from gathering and collecting sensitive digital information or intelligence about them through computer, networks and associated equipment. BWORKS is providing consultation to both government agencies and core private sector Organization against cyber espionage.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h6 class="title2">Cyber Forensics & Investigations</h6>
							<p class="desc2">The accuracy and reliability of sensitive information in an organization can be secured by extracting information and data from computer storage media. Computer crime represents one of the fastest crime rates in the country and the necessity of cyber forensic is increasing. BWORKS service decides to trace the origin of this breach. After proper analysis the source of that breach will be detected.</p>
